When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with others or from multiple workstations. Generally always, since it's
  a good practice to keep your work online as a safety precaution.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For control. And control is power. Auto pulling might result in data loss.
