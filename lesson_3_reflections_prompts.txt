When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with others or from multiple workstations. Generally always, since it's
  a good practice to keep your work online as a safety precaution.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For control. And control is power. Auto pulling might result in data loss.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a cooking utensil, clone is probably a sheep, and branch is a part of a tree.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	You know how much you are ahead of the origin/master, and what others can and cannot see.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Without Git&GitHub you'd have to collaborate via mail or share a workstation.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

	It allows for the working code in master to remain intact and experiment as much as you
	want. It's more beneficial to do this, though with small changes and fixes it's a bit
	redundant, those can be made directly on the master to keep the main branch updated.
