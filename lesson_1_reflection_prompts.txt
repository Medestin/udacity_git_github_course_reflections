How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    by showing me lines that changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it helps to find some mistakes a lot faster

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    if you do it manually and forget, you're screwed. Doing it automatically
	prevents that, but also you don't choose when to save a file, which can make
	them insignificant or too large.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programmers usually work with multiple files per project, making multiple-file 
	versio-control system very useful, whereas for writing just a text file it would
	be reduntant in 99% of the time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log shows me previous commits along with comments and diff allows me to
	compare the ones that interest me

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to when things were working

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    FOR THE HORDE!
	Kidding, just for version control of my Java projects
